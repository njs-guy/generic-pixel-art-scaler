# Generic Pixel Art Scaler

An easy way to bulk resize pixel art.

# How to compile
1. After Python is installed, install the Pillow module through pip if it's not already installed. This is used for image scaling. Usually with the following command in your terminal:
```
python -m pip install Pillow
```
To verify that Pillow is installed, use either
```
pip list
```
or make a Python script with the following code:
```
import PIL
print (PIL.__version__)
```
[More installation information can be found here.](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

2. Run in your IDE of choice.
